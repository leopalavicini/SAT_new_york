# SAT New York City Analysis

In this project, we are going to analyze if there is any influence of demographics such as race, gender, safety and more in the SAT results, and if this is the case that would suggest that the test is unfair to some students.

The project was done with open dataset made available by the New York City Government, in this repository is inside the schools folder.
